    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

    <p>The bomcheck program was originally written to be run from a Command
      Prompt Terminal
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe">(cmd.exe)</a>.
      The program <i>bomcheckgui</i> is actually a wrapper that presents a
      graphical user interface (gui) for the bomcheck program. That is, bomcheckgui
      runs the bomcheck program in the background. </p>


    <h2 id="run">How to run bomcheckgui:</h2>

    <p>Drag and drop the BOM files that you want to be checked onto the
      central portion of the gui. File names that do not end with _sw.xlsx or
      sl_xlsx will be ignored. Files that contain a tilde character, ~, will
      also be ignored.  Optionally drag and drop a directory that contains the
      BOM files.</p>

    <p>Press the green check button icon to have your BOMs analyzed. To print
      results or save results to a csv file, click the boxes located at the
      bottom of the pop up window containing results.  For more information
      about csv files, see bomcheck_help.html.</p>

    <p>To clear the list of files in the drop area, click the clear button, i.e.
      the windshield wiper icon</p>

    <p>If at some point in your work day you close the folder that contains
      your BOMs, and later you want to reopen it to make changes, instead of
      having to search for that folder again, click on the folder icon.
      Your folder will open.</p>

    <h2 id="copy_paste">How to copy & paste from a CAD BOM into ERP</h2>
    <p>If bomcheck encounters a CAD BOM for which no ERP was found to compare
    it to, bomcheckgui outputs a "CAD BOM Table" which looks like this:
    </p>

    <p>
    <img src="CAD_BOM_Table_marked.png" alt="CAD BOM Table">
    Image #1, CAD BOM Table.
    </p>

    <p>
    Into the ERP (i.e. SyteLine), after Copying, the result will look like:

    <p>
    <img src="paste_rows_append.png" alt="BOM shown in SyteLine">
    Image #2, ERP program
    </p>

    <p>Here are steps to take:</p>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>Order the columns in SyteLine like those shown in Image #2.  I.e.,
        Operation, WC, Material, Quantity, Description, and U/M</li>
        <li>From the CAD BOM Table (see image #1), copy values you want to paste
        from columns Op, WC, Item, and Q</li>
        <li>Go to the Current Materials of the Item you wish to paste the
        BOM into.  If the table is empty, click row 1 and then do <i>Edit >
        Paste Rows Append</i>.  If the table is not empty and some BOM items
        are already in place, click on the row where you would like new items
        to be inserted.</li>
        <li>Click the Save button</li>
    </ol>

    <p>When you're pasting, if an error message pops up saying Slow Inventory
    Item, or Part Doesn't exist, etc., click the button in the pop-up menu that will
    allow your paste operation to continue.  You can go back later once the pasting
    is done to make corrections.  If an item doesn't exist, you won't be able
    to save the BOM you just created.  Therefore you are forced to take steps
    to correct.</p>








    <p>Characteristics about this table that you should be aware of:</p>

    <p> 1.  If you copy a block of text from this table into the
    BOM of the ERP program, make sure the first column in the ERP BOM is <b>Op</b>,
    the second,  <b>WC</b>, the third <b>Item</b>, and the fourth <b>Qty</b>.
    Placement of other columns is not as important, but <b>Description</b> and
    <b>U/M</b> are good choices.</p>

    <p>2.  When you copy (Ctrl+C) a block of text in order to paste it into
    the ERP BOM, copy <i>ONLY</i>  the Op, WC, Item, and Q columns from the CAD BOM
    Table.  The ERP will automatically fill in the Description and U/M.</p>

    <p>3.  When you do your Ctrl+C copy, and if you additionally copy the Description
    and/or U/M, the Ctrl+C will automatically reject copying the Description and
    U/M to the clipboard.  <u>Therefore it will not be pasted.</u></p>

    <p>4.  Always use the Append menu option of the ERP program to do your
    pasting.  Avoid other methods.  They don't work.</p>

    <p>5.  If Op 10 is not the Pick op, you can change the op for a particular
    subassembly by placing the appropriate op number at first part for
    the subassembly.  The op no. for remaining subassy parts will automatically
    fill in.  Assembly 2700-2003-307 above shows a different op number.</p>

    <p>6.  If your op no. is not correct, that is, it is not a Pick op, and
    you paste in your text, the name in the WC column will not show PICK.  As
    in the table above, FAB is shown.  Therefore you should correct the op number.
    Note: Even the you pasted in <i>PICK</i>, will will not overwrite the WC
    for that Op.  This is a good thing.
